# Hangman Game
This is a Python project idea to emulate the word-guessing game, Hangman.

I’ve used a predefined list of words for the guessing aspect, but feel free to improve this by using a third-party dictionary API.

I used loops, functions, and string formatting to print the hangman’s progress.

I also you dabbled about with the standard library's random, time, and os modules.

## How To?
- Simply run the main.py file and enjoy the well crafted and witty [bash-terminal] gameplay.
